		<h2>Passing</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>(adj. & v.)Trans* people being accepted as, or able to “pass for,” a member of their self-identified gender identity (regardless of sex assigned at birth) without being identified as trans*. </li>
			<li>(adj. & v.)An LGB/queer individual who is believed to be or perceived as straight.</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Passing is a controversial term because it often is focusing on the person who is observing or interacting with the individual who is “passing” and puts the power/authority in observer rather than giving agency to the individual.</li>
			<li>While some people are looking to “pass” or perhaps more accurately be accepted for the identity that they feel most aligns with who they are “passing” is not always a positive experience.</li>
			<li>Some individuals experience a sense of erasure or a feeling of being invisible to their own community when they are perceived to be part of the dominant group.</li>
