		<h2>Gay</h2>

			<li>(adj.)Individuals who are primarily emotionally, physically, and/or sexually attracted to members of the same sex and/or gender. More commonly used when referring to men who are attracted to other men, but can be applied to women as well. </li>
			<li>(adj.)An umbrella term used to refer to the queer community as a whole, or as an individual identity label for anyone who does not identify as heterosexual.</li>

			<li>“Gay” is a word that’s had many different meanings throughout time. In the 12th century is meant “happy,” in the 17th century it was more commonly used to mean “immoral” (describing a loose and pleasure-seeking person), and by the 19th it meant a female prostitute (and a “gay man” was a guy who had sex with female prostitutes a lot). It wasn’t until the 20th century that it started to mean what it means today. Interesting, right?</li>
