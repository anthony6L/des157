      Since I want to make my project a quick first stop for younger audiences, after the first storyboard prototyping, I realized that having a "stories" section would be too complicated. Also it would be very difficult to maintain that section as a safe space.
      I would have to constantly check and monitor the forum-like section, which would make the sharing process be really slow. So I decided to change that section to be a page with links to other resources instead. One of the resource would be the Trever
      project which provide that service for teens and young adults. They actually do check and monitor everything everyone on there posts to maintain a safe space for these younger users.

      In the secon iteration, I organized my storyboard with a better order of frames making it easier to understand. I also incorporated the change I wanted to make after the first iteraton to have the resource page to replace the story or forum page. To further
      improve, adding different colors to the labels on the initial page to represent the rainbow theme would help both the appearance and the organization if I catagorise the labels by color themes.
