    <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
    <p>
      There are many labels in the LGBT<sup>+</sup> community, and new labels are constantly being added. I lived through my teenage years in a relatively conservative part of the country, and there were very limited resources accessible to me regarding
      gender identity and sexuality issues. Through this project, I want to present a simple but fun starting point for younger audiences to explore their identities and understand all the different labels people use and identifies as. I want to emphasize
      that gender identity is separate from sexuality. Also, I want to let them know that these labels are only there to help people to communicate with other, and they do not and cannot define a person.

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The primary target audience is preteen to teenage kids who are exploring their own identities or trying to understand the different terms used to describe identities. A slight emphasize in more conservative areas where internet could be the only resource
      they have access to. The page can also be an intro resource for anyone else that want to learn about LGBT<sup>+</sup> terminologies.

    <h2>Mission & Methods</h2>
    <p>
      I want this to be educational/informational while still being fun, so I am using the 3D library three.js to present each terminology as a 3D label. Also, personally, long paragraphs of information is discouraging. Most of teens feel the same way, so I
      am keeping the information inside of each pop-up label short and easy to read. Many people tend to focus too much on the labels and terminologies when they first starting to learn about them, so I am dedicating a whole page to show the message that
      people are more than the labels.

    <h2>Communication Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      For the labels, the user will only see the name of the label at first. When they click, then the pop-up appear with a short and easy-to-read information introducing that specific label. For the external resources, user will see the tittle of the site,
      which should give them an idea of what that site is for, and they will also see a very brief (one to two sentences) introduction of the site to help further explain the site.

    <h2>Visual Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      I am using the 3D library to simulate the physical experience of "exploring", which can help making the learning experience more fun. I am using different color to represent gender identities and sexualities to indicate that they are not necessarily related.
      Then the resources are in green, which is a calming color indicating that they can get help. I am using a sans serif typeface to match the futuristic style of the page, which is my way of saying the future is all inclusive no matter how one identifies.
