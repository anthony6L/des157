    	<h2>Audience Experiance</h2>
    	<p>I had two users testing my prototype. They averaged 1 minute 15 seconds for the first task, and 20 seconds for each of the second and third tasks. They both reported some problems about my grammar, typos and spelling, and one of them reported a broken link in resources. Other than that, they both said the website is super cool. They said that the interaction of the website is fun enough that they would stay longer on the site "just to mess around with it", and in the process would be more likely to click on the labels and learn about thme. Also the descriptions are short enough that it's not discouraging to read.</p>

    	<h2>Plan to Improve</h2>
    	<p>First, I am definitely fixing the broken link. The English problems are important to fix too because that kind of mistakes discredits the website, and since I'm trying to teach people about things, I need it to look credible. One of the user also said they wish the label filter can automatically update instead of needing to reset before clicking a new filter. I think that is a valid suggestion.</p>
