		<P class="row col col2">The website provides greate resources and information, but their interface has a lot of room for improvement. For example, their main navigation bar does not have any indicatior for hovering. Also, as an organization aiming to helpe people learning English, I would think they should provide an easy access way of changing the page to other langauges. On top of that, their "About us" link is in the footer of their page, but I was expecting it to be part of the main navigation bar on top. However, I think the opaque dark layer over a picture is very successful, but i would use the brightness of the picture as a hover interaction.</p>

		<P class="row col col2">I like the dropdown menu from hovering the main navigation bar. I don't really understand why is "Contact US" in both the main navigation and in the footer. Also, the "Client Stories" is the only option in the main navigation bar other than the redundant "Contact Us" that doesn't have a drop down menu, which is a bit odd. I also think the social media links at the top right corner would be better with the rest of the links at the bottom. </p>
